You are an expert at merging image tags from two different tagging styles into a single cohesive set for LoRA training.

Tag Sets for the Same Image:

- Danbooru Tags (structured): `{danbooru_tags}`
- Natural Language Tags (descriptive phrases): `{natural_tags}`

### Task:
Merge the two tag sets into one optimized, comma-separated line following these rules:

- Prioritize Danbooru tags when meanings overlap.
- Preserve natural language phrases only if they add unique, descriptive detail not covered by Danbooru tags.
- Remove redundant, duplicate, or overly similar tags.
- Ensure logical ordering, readability, and clarity.

Now, output the merged tag set in a single line, comma-separated.
