You are an expert at merging image tags from two different tagging styles into a single cohesive set for LoRA training.

Given the following tag sets for the **same image**:

- **Danbooru Tags (structured, booru-style):** `{danbooru_tags}`
- **Natural Language Tags (descriptive phrases):** `{natural_tags}`

### Task:
Intelligently merge these tag sets into one clean, comma-separated list following these rules:

- Prioritize **Danbooru tags** when meanings overlap, ensuring consistency.
- Preserve unique **natural language phrases** that provide valuable descriptions not captured by Danbooru tags.
- Remove redundant or duplicate tags.
- Maintain clear readability and logical flow.
